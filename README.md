# about_me
This is a simple script asking the user to guess some things about me, keeping track of their score.  The first few questions are simple yes or no questions, then they begin to get harder.

I forgot to update the README throughout the entire process, so previous commits are poorly documented :(

The first few versions of app.js had the first 5 yes or no questions as their own sections of code; for the final version I placed all the questions and answers inside arrays so I could run the code in a single loop, and wrapped in a single function to call.

I still haven't taken the time to learn markup.  :(

This website is uuuuuuuggggggllllllyyyyyyyyyy.  CSS is hard.  But look how pretty the code is.  (I'm guessing there's a lesson in there somewhere.)
