        I hope you enjoyed my game.  Here are the answers to the questions:
    </h2>
        <h3>
            <ol>
                <li>I do not own a car.  Haven't owned one in 5 years.  I love bikes though!  I've ridden all over the country and I'm currently working as a bicycle courier here in Seattle.  I'm terrible at ping pong but I'll accept any challengers to a lunchtime bike race.</li>
                <li>Javascript isn't technically my first experience with programming, but it's been a very long time.  When I was a kid, my dad taught me to program in BASIC on our Commodore 64.  Later on I did some scripting (in a language I believe was loosely based on perl) and some basic HTML design.  (Back when all HTML design was basic.)</li>
                <li>I have never jumped out of an airplane, but I did get an Abrams tank airborne once.</li>
                <li>I did swim with dolphins, but not on purpose.  My kayak sprung a leak and capsized 5 miles out in the Gulf of Mexico and a pod of dolphins showed up around sunset while I was floating back to shore and kept popping up next to me for a while.  Some of life's most beautiful moments are in the middle of its disasters.</li>
                <li>Not even a little bit, but we'll roll with it.</li>
            </ol>
        </h3>
        <h3>
            <p>I had a lot of fun making this.  Working my way around the various problems that came up was sometimes frustrating, but also rewarding.  The code got a lot more fun as it transitioned from a broken, ugly mess into something functional and streamlined, to an end result I'm proud of.  The code ended up being the easy part.  The more I try to do to the CSS the worse I make everything look.  Going to need to go back and reread all of the material before I try to do anything else to it.</p>
        For the sake of making lists, here are the places I was stationed while I was in the Army:
